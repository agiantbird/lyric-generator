    Two cloves garlic finely minced
    I am not all that convinced
    that you ever loved me
    that I ever really let you
    chili powder, MSG
    are you god damn kidding me
    this isn’t getting better
    this won’t do
    Some salt and pepper, more to taste
    what a shame what waste
    spent time and energy
    nothing gained
    Potatoes, spinach, navy beans
    how loud can I scream
    before anybody checks on me?
    A sour taste and rotten luck
    what the hell how the fuck
    can I hold this together
    what can I do?
    what can I do?
    what will I do?
    Hello friend it’s me again
    you just popped into my head
    do I pop into your head?
    hello friend it’s me again
    they tell me you’re drinking again
    seems like a good time for it
    can’t blame you too much for it
    hello friend it’s me again
    you just popped into my head
    hello friend I’m in my head
    I’ve been drinking some again
    can you blame me much for it?
    Do you get stuck in your head?
    hello friend it’s me again
    Hello there it’s me your friend
    heard you cut your hair again
    I think that’s good now and then
    change as good as vacation
    I don’t cut my hair often
    might just take a vacation
    hello friend its me again
    might get out to the Hudson
    head out to the water's edge
    and walk until I am drinking
    every breath that’s coming in
    friend I’m in over my head
    Do you get in over your head?
    hello friend it’s me again
    I heard birds chirping in blues, yellows and greens
    I felt the heat breathe in through the window
    Barely 9 a.m. in Andalusia
    Dead of night back where you are
    I wrote you a letter I won’t be sending
    I have a song that I won't sing
    We lead the horse away from the water
    Right when it was about to drink
    I dress lightly in bright colors
    As the heat index climbed
    You were stirring from your slumber
    In another place and time
    I have a memory that’s fast fading
    I have a thought that I won’t speak
    We lead the horse away from water
    Just as it was gonna drink
    I broke down on my way to New Jersey then so did my car
    I pulled over the shoulder wondered how I got so far
    from the commonwealth of Massachusetts
    and its black capped chickadee?
    The state bird of Jersey’s a goldfinch
    and that means nothing to me
    I broke down on my way to New Jersey
    then so did my car
    I broke into death’s house to visit you
    Broke his window with a heavy photo album I’d been lugging around
    We ate his groceries
    jumped on his bed
    threw on his robes and we cried out loud:
    Merry Christmas,
    Merry Christmas,
    and Happy New Year
    'Forever' is a word that should have more letters
    'Final' could be longer, too
    Stupid thoughts I guess,
    I thought I’d be less of a mess
    I just miss walking toward you
    And all I’ve seemed able to figure out
    is that life is a thing that happens
    How long does it take modern dates to feel old?
    'Oh, ages', you said, as you spun on your toes
    How long to write lines no one already knows?
    'Oh, ages', you said, as you spun on your toes
    Don't measure time
    by how a body sways
    I measure time by how a body grows
    Don't measure time
    by how a body sways
    I measure time by how a body breaks down
    My body's breaking down
    The prison siren signaled your barbed wire mood
    so I came at you as soft as I could
    I stole flowers from cacti
    apologized for old crimes
    I left you offerings
    I let you be
    You said 'I know what you're doing,
    it won't work on me',
    but in between your words, I saw it flashing:
    a yellow bird between your teeth
    Zen sword karate dojo vaulting on my left
    gas station across the street
    where there’s gasoline
    where the cigarettes sleep
    Flash of lights and I wonder how often
    the cop that turns them on and off an on and
    how often they look up
    for delinquents, or maybe for angels
    I’m not supposed to have
    this roof access
    my landlord put a lock on the door
    but I cracked it
    From up here I can see my city
    while I think about
    how to hide from it
    while I think about
    how I’m part of it
    up here on the roof
    Slammed my head on an Escher-angled cabinet
    heard your laughter take flight right away
    saw your hands held up in an apologetic front
    as I rubbed the once-soft spot above my brain
    And I remembered that I love you
    not that I ever forgot
    but the days stretch long and the nights yawn wide
    and it’s nice to be gripped by that soft, wild thought
    It must be summer ‘cause the ants have come
    with their strange, machine movements
    and their familiar, blind search for something sweet
    I hate them
    and we hate this heat and we hate
    that we love each other, we love each other
    more than we’ll admit
    we climb in bed and wait for shade
    It’ll be a while before we get it
    More ice,
    more ice,
    more ice
    Be nice
    My mom’s the latest in a great
    sword-swallowing tradition
    she slides the sharp things into her gut
    My father is a fire-breather
    he’s all violent burst and flash and heat
    everything he does, he overdoes
    And I’m all sad clown tumbles
    as I try to distract and divert us
    ladies and gentlemen,
    isn't this a fine circus?
    This was a hard year
    I didn’t tell anyone
    I didn’t tell my friends
    I didn’t want to bother them
    I took
    a multivitamin
    I sucked air into my lungs
    I combed my hair
    I bit my tongue
    Your song floats from the kitchen
    some strange new melody
    toast on the breakfast table
    topped with golden drops of medlar jelly
    And the breakfast and the kitchen and your voice
    and the breathing heat of day
    and the toast and the song and the table
    and the one thing out of place
    and the one thing out of place
    I don’t remember buying medlar jelly
    I don’t remember planting medlar trees
    These things have to rot before ripening
    just what are you trying to tell me?
    What are you trying to tell me?
    That night is darkest before the dawn?
    That bodies float after they drown?
    That what doesn’t kill you makes you strong?
    That what must go up must come down?
    I’ve never been good at visual art
    but here you go, I drew you a heart
    It’s got our names on the inside
    It don’t look great, at least I tried
    At least I’m trying
    at least I’m trying
    To show that you are
    the ‘is’ in my sentence
    and my minute’s second hand
    With all of my being and seeming
    I love you more than
    I understand
    I love you more than
    you understand
    So here you go, I drew you a heart
    I’m not too great at visual art
    It’s got our names on the inside
    Looks like an egg, at last I tried
    When the knife man came
    with his special knife sharpening apparatus
    we let him on in
    there was nothing else for it
    there was nothing else for it
    When the knife man came
    with his crisp black jacket
    and strapping good looks
    you smiled like a saint,
    I smiled like a crook
    and while he sorted out our cutlery
    we drew shades and we locked the doors
    You gave me a look like you were thinking
    I don't think too much anymore
    and when he asked how our knives get so dull
    a window flew open
    Saw you sitting on a porch in Allston
    while the sun was setting on Boston
    your shirt was off
    your hat was on
    You seemed so happy
    you seemed so sad
    well me too,
    brother, me too
    And hornets take nectar
    but they don't make honey
    we drink Narragansett
    with Del's lemonade
    We smoke and sip sweet and sour
    as wasps find sleep in flowers,
    or in the eaves of the old porch
    and the fire escape
    Forgive me father
    forgive me mother too
    goodbye my god
    hello to you,
    something newly wakened
    gaining strength,
    already strong
    willing to go where I won't,
    do what I don't
    a mad barking dog
    And I apologize to everyone
    but I am not sorry
    for breaking loose and
    hopping fence and running far
    from me, the me you thought
    I was, that just ain't me
    that just ain't me
    A Lasko, ceramic, electric heating fan
    humming in the corner steady, true
    if this fan can create artificial warmth,
    baby, maybe I can fake it too
    I hold you close
    I turn up the heat
    I tried hard to remember you
    it was like trying to hold water in my hand's loose palm
    it was like trying to remember the fireworks of autumn
    it was a silly thing to do
    it's hard to recall things like soft and warm
    but I tried to remember you anyway
    you came into the shop the other day and
    I was way off
    you came into the shop
    I was way off
    Broke into a flock of yourself
    jackets like banners in the wind
    laughter like the beat of birds wings
    like your hair curling
    and the wind hurt my eyes
    I am crying
    I am laughing
    I am laughing and I feel good
    We were painting over everything
    white wash, new beginnings
    we're allergic to symbols and meaning
    we were left scratching our arms
    It's headache season
    right on time
    It's headache season
    and the weather's fine
    Sweep the whispers from the corners
    leave the outlets in the walls
    turn the radio up loud
    catch the rise and fall
    of songs with no commercial potential
    as we say goodbye
    It's leaving season
    right on time
    it's leaving season
    and the weather's fine
    Two years in a place and you grow a certain way
    two years packed up in the back of a truck
    two years in a place and you grow to fit its shape
    you're heading south, things are looking up
    And I think I'll miss you
    but I don't think I'll call
    wish you good luck
    hope you won't need it at all
    It’s been a bad year weather-wise
    and in every other way
    I checked out the forecast
    for the next five days
    It said rain is so likely
    that it’s outright guaranteed
    you can’t spin gold from straw
    or hope from certainty
    Try to stay dry
    try to not drown
    hold out for the 10-day
    do what you can for now
    If there's a heaven
    and they’re kind and dumb enough to let me in
    I hope it's got an elevator
    Something vague and wonderful at the end
    that you know you'll get to
    sooner or later
    And you lean against the railing and think
    about nothing in particular
    Maybe kissing
    maybe fireworks
    probably kissing
    And as the numbers count up
    you fall in love with the idea
    of arrival
    We learned to smile by hiding
    knives inside our teeth
    kept our arms at our sides
    with daggers up our sleeves
    the day has finally come
    we've long since reckoned
    The devil's in the details
    we are detail-oriented
    And I don't love anyone but you
    And I don't trust anyone
    And I don't love anyone but you
    And I don't trust anyone
    What am I gonna do?
    What am I gonna do
    with you?
    Will I pick you up?
    Will I take you home?
    What am I gonna do?
    What am I gonna do
    with you?
    Will I say goodbye?
    Will I let you go?
    I woke up
    had my breakfast of
    multivitamins and
    anti-inflammatories
    wondered what the day had
    in store for me
    What inevitable 'uh ohs' of cartoon physics
    would visit upon me
    as I give chase
    to the one thing that matters to me
    An anvil might drop on my head
    I might get hit with a baby grand
    come through the top,
    cracked smile of ivory keys
    as I give chase
    to the one thing that matters to me
    I've got a brain full of gunpowder
    a heart full of TNT
    and a detonator held by
    the one person
    who matters to me
    The following is a list of actual last words which I invented:
    "Watch this!"
    "See you tomorrow."
    "I can too juggle that!"
    "Yes."
    "Grande iced coffee."
    "Nurse!"
    "I've got a good feeling about this."
    "Hello?"
    "Where are all my damn socks?"
    "What the hell is that?"
    "What? Am I gonna die or something?"
    "Is today or Tuesday or Wednesday– oh, it's Wednesday."
    "Relax, it's not loaded."
    "Red on yellow. . . is a friendly fellow!"
    "Ah, shit!"
    "No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!"
    "What was I doing?"
    "I'll be fine."
    "Okay, let's try it without the harness."
    "Huh, it's never made that noise before."
    "I don't know."
    "Yes, I'll hold."
    "I think it's safe now."
    "What am I doing with my life?"
    "Good."
    "Just two more days."
    "You can go fuck yourself!"
    "Thank you."
    "Goodbye."
    Red wine stains on my cigarette filters
    what am I doing with my body?
    what am I doing with anybody?
    I'm an agent of harm
    I'm a vulnerable target
    I flash red warnings
    I hope you'll ignore it
    I'm the worst kind of worst kind of misery
    and I need company
    and I'd love company
    We can get better tomorrow
    we can get better somehow
    we'll steal medicine and
    even take the right amount
    tomorrow
    I was not built for this word,
    I need to sleep in branches,
    to hide in your hair
    Winter is coming, winter is wild
    let us disconnect from the ground
    dwell here, do well here
    hang streamers from the walls
    Between fall and winter
    we'll have our own season to rejoice
    I will not build you a temple, no,
    if given a choice
    I'll build you a cabin
    I'll build you a shack
    I'll tear it down in time
    next autumn I'll be back
    I love you so, I love you so, I love you so,
    crisp red, orange, yellow, then you go
    We let the evening slide
    I left and it was cold outside
    all that moved was in migration
    or in states of hibernation
    Where will you go when the world turns cold?
    Where will you go when the world turns cold?
    We said goodbye
    I left and it was cold outside
    We were the seed
    that became the sapling
    that became the need
    that was fed by the waters
    that bore limbs that grew
    leaves that feasted on sunlight
    and breathed in reverse
    rested birds between their flights
    Our love grows
    for one another
    we are branched growth
    and patient wonder
    As children we worshipped home
    wild and reckless
    armed with markers and felt-tips
    we scribbled manic hieroglyphs on the walls
    relished the soft flow of our graffiti
    drew hearts and stars and plants
    and cars and bugs and mom and glory
    Like a Norman Rockwell b-side
    we climbed each other’s shoulders
    stole cookies from Folgers jars
    turned our home into a den of thieves
    ran away, height a combined wobble
    chirping nervous like church mice
    a tower of crumb flecked babble
    And for a while it was Eden
    our mother charming snakes from her clothes
    dad drinking aluminum
    taking in her sun dress flow
    And for a while it was Eden
    mom charming snakes from tomatoes
    dad drinking aluminum
    garden letting go the evening’s glow
    We grew to adolescents
    tore down the stairs
    like eager young heretics
    skipped the last steps to get out the door
    and curfews surfaced on the skin of our home
    I hate this house we shouted out
    seeing red and feeling purple
    Then came the exodus
    to work, to school,
    across state lines, and overseas
    Home became a photo album thing
    a collection of memories
    of our child bodies
    of half-remembered parties and when mom was pretty
    Mom’s still
    pretty
    Mom's still
    pretty
    And for a while it was Eden
    our mother charming snakes from her clothes
    dad drinking aluminum
    taking in her sun dress flow
    And for a while it was Eden
    our mother chasing snakes from tomatoes
    dad drinking aluminum
    garden letting go the evening’s glow
    We meant to return home
    distance made us nostalgic
    but we were soon distracted
    by our fine-featured friends and their new ideas
    so adult and exciting with their complications
    And their slip-shod temple bedrooms
    housing subleased veneration
    Glory, glory, glory
    But a house and a home
    are not one in the same
    one is a structure
    and one is a name
    you give to the comfort
    that keeps you warm and sane
    worth worship and return
    again and again
    oh Home, Home, Home
    hallowed be the name
    for a while at least
    but worshipers grow weary
    and days are just so long
    And for a while it was Eden
    then we let the weeds grow
    we let the shingles slide
    we let things go
    But there will come that night
    when you wake to a room full of blue
    with that old house calling you
    you’ll drive back, climb through the window
    lie on the floor, fingers like threshers in the carpet
    eyes shut then open, and you'll say it:
    I lived here
    I lived here
    I lived
    When there was no doing left to do
    No making to make
    we curled up like dogs
    Warmth, I felt it
    warmth
    And a smile broke at your lips
    you were dreaming in your sleep
    something soft and sweet
    Warmth, I felt it
    warmth, I felt it
    warmth
    I'm all for letting my
    dumb, animal body
    love what it loves
    But I won't let my
    dumb, animal body
    hurt what it hurts
    I want to be wild
    don't want to be reckless
    I don't have to be good
    but I'd like you and I
    to want to be
    no matter how lonely
    no matter how lonely
    no matter how lonely
    I want to be good
    We went to the party supply store
    which no one really goes to anymore
    it didn’t feel much like a party inside
    Got what we came for
    found it there on the sales floor
    deep dark interior, all rainbow outside
    Took it home  and put it up on the table
    filled it up as best as we were able
    as much as the paper mâché could hold
    Poured in licorice and jelly beans
    sweet tarts, broke hearts, our car keys
    addresses from places no longer home
    change in our pockets and our ids
    credit cards, lighters, and tv screens
    people we’ve been meaning to call and those we won’t
    Toss them in
    watch them go
    Toss them in
    watch them go
    Throw in the pets you’ve loved
    and those you’ve failed
    your medical records, your junk mail
    the monster under your bed and god
    For this to work you should get in too
    amongst the candy, god, and things you’ve lived through
    but then there’d be no one to raise it up
    So just picture yourself in the padded dark
    inside a donkey shape, hanging in stark
    contrast to the sky’s expanse of blue
    When you’re ready grab the branch you selected
    weeks ago for this, and calm, and collected,
    and eager as Christmas morning and wack like hell
    Eyes open or closed, screaming, laughing or crying
    just keep swinging, as everything goes flying
    just keep swinging, just keep holding on
    And when it all breaks open and the world spills out
    let yourself dive down to start
    the hand-over-fist, manic scramble to take it all back again,
    take it all back again
    The champagne bottle popped
    in my chest
    gasping trout flowed from the neck
    I could hear machines
    my father’s slurred histories
    and I waltzed
    with my dad's memory
    and his tendencies
    Someone must stay awake to plant each stem pulled
    someone must stay awake to keep the clock honest
    someone must stay awake to let the cold in from the cold
    someone must stay awake to watch it all go on
    Someone must stay awake to keep the lamp company
    someone must stay awake through the night
    someone must stay awake to see each nesting bird slowly
    wake and startle itself with flight
    wake, startle, surprise itself with flight
    We were all pizza grease and smiling teeth
    as we piled in our fall-apart cars
    sun bleeding like God’s open throat
    all over Cape Cod
    I caught your eyes in the rear-view mirror
    quickly looked away
    didn’t know what we were doing
    still don’t to this day
    But we’re still trying
    still driving
    still aiming at something better
    aiming away from something worse
    As sharks beach themselves on sandbars
    and our car speeds past the rest
    we shout for joy or just to make noise
    and then we gasp for breath
    and then we gasp for breath
    I got older, I got dumber
    I got colder what a bummer
    I don’t talk to my friends
    If I don’t talk to them,
    are they even my friends?
    I got strung out too many times
    I got hung out to dry
    now I lie down most evenings
    now I don’t even try
    I mean, why would I?
    What a bummer
    I don’t think I’m growing
    I don’t think I’m having fun
    I might die of old age young
    Every night I dream of falling asleep
    and every morning I wake up tired
    and it’s all I can do to keep
    to keep up with the upkeep I require
    And you're trying to talk to me
    and you want to know what I think
    you want to know how I feel
    you want so many things
    I’ve got some side effects
    I’ve got some small defects
    and something more complex
    I think I need some rest, but
    Every night I dream of falling asleep
    and every morning I wake up tired
    and it’s all I can do to keep
    to keep up with the upkeep I require
    Don't think I'll ever be great
    oh great, ah shit
    and I am learning
    to be okay with it
    wouldn't that be great?
    ah shit
    if I could learn to be okay?
    wouldn't that be great?
    Don't think I have a good mind
    I don't mind, but still,
    I don't think it's organized or thinks well
    I don't know what to think
    Oh well, ah hell
    I don't know what to think
    Don't think I'll ever be great
    oh great, ah shit
    and I am learning
    to be okay with it
    wouldn't that be great?
    ah shit
    to learn to be okay?
    to learn to be okay?
    Today I am not myself
    I think out loud
    I think out loud
    Then I think about
    who is thinking about
    who is thinking
    It’s a miracle I’ve
    managed to survive
    It’s a miracle I haven’t
    lost my mind
    I’ve been everywhere I go
    but nothing stays it all goes
    I’ve been everywhere I go
    I can’t remember; I don’t know
    The sun had sharpened itself against winter
    and sent headache light through the windshield and sent me wincing
    and with a head full of sunlight I tell myself things will get better
    but it’s a half-hearted argument and I’m slowly convincing myself
    To give up
    to pull over
    to throw up
    my hands
    and the contents
    of my stomach
    again and again
    but I’ll keep driving
    a little while
    and hope that little while builds
    some momentum,
    If I can just get some momentum,
    I’ll be alright
    Let’s live in billboards
    let’s breathe neon and dust
    let’s eat plastic
    let’s stop trying to adjust
    To the new times times new roman size 78 point fonts
    screaming that everything is fucked
    Come on baby let’s give up
    let’s lean in hard
    let’s give up
    You smell like perfume and kerosene
    what have you done?
    what will you do next?
    can I come along?
    I don’t want to aid you
    don’t want to abet
    I just don’t want to you to do
    something you might regret
    So I’ll be the lookout
    drive the getaway car
    keep you distracted from yourself
    and away from harm
    You smell like perfume and kerosene
    what have you done?
    It's been Saturday night all morning
    it's been raining, you're complaining
    about your head
    We tied one on last night
    then we tied one on again and again
    We drank like fish
    we sank like stones
    tried to drown our sorrow
    tried our best to stay afloat
    Ten minutes in the shower, I've lost hours
    trying to fight what's coming up
    and something's fighting inside
    and if it wins at least I did this to myself
    My head under water
    a clicking in my bones
    try to drown your sorrow
    try to stay afloat
    It's been Saturday night all morning
    it's been raining, you're complaining
    about your head
    I remember you best
    in supermarkets
    surrounded by products
    and options in excess
    How you moved
    undistracted, undeterred
    towards what you wanted
    You wrote it all out on a list
    went out and got it
    I wrote your name down
    a thousand times
    but it won’t bring you back one bit
    no it won’t bring you back one bit
    I’m surrounded in this supermarket
    I’m distracted in this supermarket
    and I don’t need much to exist
    only twelve items or less
    no, I don’t need much to live
    I am lonely in this supermarket
    I remember
    I remember
    I just need to rest my eyes
    I just need to catch my breath
    I’ve said goodbye to so many friends
    I have seen too many deaths
    I’ll be fine
    hell I’m alive
    I must be fine
    if I’m alive
    I just miss you
    I just miss you
    I just miss you
    I miss your eyes
    I miss your eyes
    I miss your breath
    I miss your size
    Sorry I always cry
    I just need to catch my breath
    I’m sorry you’re seeing me like this
    I’m not
    touching you
    you said, holding your finger in front of my head
    I’ve lost
    touch with my friends
    I realize holding my head in my hands
    You call me names
    you pull my hair
    I don’t care, but wait a minute, shouldn’t I care?
    I could call my friends
    I could use their names
    I could sit here pulling the hair from my head
    I could call my friends
    I could use their names
    I pushed on your chest
    you breathed in my lungs
    we both did our best
    to keep this going on
    You took my breath away
    I choked on your tongue
    we both did our best
    our best isn’t good enough
    We push and pull
    air stops and goes
    blood moves and pools
    things decompose
    So here we stand,
    mouth-to-mouth,
    and hand-in-hand
    I’m going to love you my whole life
    and through as many resurrections as I can
    Regardless of how severe most bleeding can be controlled
    most times bleeding will even stop on its own
    through intricate miracles our bodies
    our broken bodies can make themselves whole
    But if you’re bleeding too much you could die from shock and loss
    so bandage the wound with cloth and gauze
    and apply direct pressure to help form clots
    squeeze yourself tight to help with the loss
    Don’t bleed out
    don’t bleed out
    don’t bleed out
    fight the loss
    You’ve been in the cold too long now
    you’re in trouble
    bring inside now
    your bones, your blood, and muscle
    Drink something warm and sweet
    and let us treat you
    And wrap your bones in wool and blankets
    built up like soft embankments
    around you
    and your blood flow
    come in from the cold
    come in where its warm
    you don’t have to be alone and cold
    Are you aware of where you are?
    Has something gone on?
    You seem off
    Do you have a headache?
    Can you concentrate?
    Has the spinning stopped?
    Can you just keep still?
    Can you just slow down
    and catch your breathing
    back up with itself?
    Can I see your eyes?
    Can I hear your breath?
    Do you want some water?
    How’s your sense of balance?
    Just keep talking
    tell me anything
    help’s on the way
    come on stay with me
    You learned the current-voltage characteristic of skin
    first-hand from a faulty appliance
    you saw nothing but heavenly white light for a moment
    and quickly lost consciousness
    We found you in a clumsy cruciform
    splayed on the old floor of the kitchen
    your heart dancing to an erratic pulse
    wild fluttering in your eyelids
    wild fluttering in your eyelids
    Nobody dared touch you
    we called for help, it came from god knows where
    we reached our hands out over you
    and felt a charge in the air
    My hands feel hollow
    there’s a twitch in right knee
    I’m short of breath and I'm
    pretty far from me
    Inhale for five seconds
    I hold for two
    I breathe out,
    what the hell am I going to do
    what am I going to do
    I need to get out
    I need to get calm
    I need to stop ticking down these thoughts,
    shaking palms, time bomb
    I need to get out
    I need to get calm
    shaking hands,
    sweaty palms,
    time bomb
    Down here the heat can kill you
    down here you should keep to the shade
    down here the heat can kill you
    hey, what did I say
    Keep your skin covered
    watch your heart rate
    try to keep a cool head
    try to keep your thoughts straight
    Try to find cool
    water
    Try to find cool
    water
    Try to find cool
    water
    Try to cool down
    Stood up too fast
    collapsed into darkness
    fell into dreaming
    of far away friends
    Woke up bruised
    and groggy and reminded
    I wasn't build for sudden
    moves or sudden ends
    Stood up too fast
    (It's in our blood)
    collapsed into darkness
    fell into dreaming
    of far away friends
    Woke up bruised
    (You're in my blood)
    and groggy and reminded
    I wasn't build for sudden
    moves or sudden ends
    Don't get fancy it just has to work
    start one joint up from the break
    use sticks for splints and padding from clothing
    make sure blood circulates
    This is gonna hurt
    I can't stress it enough
    but you'll survive
    and get fixed up
    the piece of you that broke
    will grow back strong and tough
    what doesn't kill you
    still fucking sucks
    Use sticks for splints tear up your clothing
    tie things together with a shoelace
    show up barefoot, broken, bruised but living
    get help putting pieces back in place
    get help putting the pieces back in place
    This is gonna hurt
    kid, if you only knew
    you survived so much
    you'll survive this too
    and what you broke
    will grow back strong and true
    what doesn't kill you
    doesn't kill you
    I’ve got benedictions
    I’ve got trauma dressings
    triangular bandages,
    healing prayers and blessings
    I’ve got assurances
    I’ve got duct tape
    I’ve got some medical training
    and a little bit of faith
    I can’t fix you
    I can’t make you whole
    but I can keep you stable
    until better hands can work some miracle
    I’ve got vinyl gloves
    I’ve got a field guide
    tweezers, sterile shears,
    hydrogen peroxide
    I’ve got words of encouragement
    a kind lie or two
    it’s not so bad you know
    nothing you won't make it through
    nothing you won't make it through
    And I can’t fix you,
    I can’t work miracles
    but I can keep you stable
    until better hands can make you whole
    Phthalocyanine green G
    is a synthetic, green pigment
    made from a complex of copper
    and chlorinated phthalocyanine
    It’s useful because it’s stable
    It’s prized for its viridian hue
    It’s cheap to manufacture
    ultimately derived from phthalocyanine blue
    By chlorination in the presence
    of aluminum trichloride
    I learned all these things
    but I’m still color blind
    And in much the same way,
    I learned each shade of each
    of your colors and moods
    Who the hell knows,
    who the hell knows,
    who the hell knows
    what else I’ve overlooked
    Try to follow clues I left myself years before
    cryptic junk drawer artifacts and hazy impressions
    unsure the last time things felt straightforward
    now they radiate outward in every direction
    I try to write something
    I don’t write much
    wonder how much I am forgetting
    how much I have forgot
    There was something important
    I was supposed to do
    something important for someone
    I don't remember who
    There was something important
    I was supposed to do
    something for someone
    I don't remember who
    You and your Joan of Arc haircut
    you were cutting your way through the crowd
    weighing choices, hearing voices
    one cut through, strong and loud
    I must do this thing, I must go
    for it is willed that I do so
    As enemies close in
    and judges push for false confession
    keep your chin up and your mouth closed
    don’t give the bastards any fucking satisfaction
    Burn and rave
    rage and fight
    hold dear to your love
    hold more dear to your spite
    I'm nothing to so many
    it’s no matter; I don’t mind
    who has the will, who has the time
    to live in so many other lives
    So I focused my attention
    in everything that I do
    I’m so happy, I'm so proud
    to be something for you
    No desire, drive or talent
    for any kind of fame
    uncomfortable at the thought
    of catching any stranger with my name
    So I focus my attention
    in everything I do
    I’m so happy, I'm so proud
    to be something for you
    Let your garden grow weeds
    mix salt in the soil
    let the walls fall
    let the crops spoil
    Abandon all hope
    abandon all else
    this world will break your spirit if it finds it,
    so destroy it first yourself
    A kingfisher flew out over the lake
    with a cry of manic laughter
    we planted seeds in garden beds
    we burned the earth soon after
    Abandon all hope
    abandon all else
    this world will break your spirit if it finds it
    so destroy it first yourself
    What are you saying?
    Can you say it again?
    Can you say it slower?
    I wasn't listening
    What are you saying?
    Can you say it again?
    Can you put it into words I can understand?
    Who died and made you king?
    Who cares what you're saying?
    So much to look at and you said, "Look at me!"
    So much to listen to and you just had to speak!
    What are you saying?
    Can you say it again?
    Can you say it slower?
    I wasn't listening
    Houston, we have an, aw fuck, oh no,
    can you hear me ground control?
    Yes we hear you, please go
    yes we hear you, please go
    Houston, I’m spinning out in space
    I have no weight
    I’m in rough shape
    Yes we hear you, please go
    please report, what’s the status quo?
    The status quo is, and I quote,
    "All fucked up and about to blow"
    We hear you, let this one go
    we hear you please don’t explode
    The holding pattern has become the flight path
    the proof of concept's become the plan
    Please float in space in figure eights
    until you have control again
    On my way up a mountain in Jilin province
    I got an object lesson in providence
    maybe it was just the lack of oxygen
    but my head felt light, the sun felt good
    There’s a lake up here they named after heaven
    kids stare at the water, laugh at the reflection
    of the faces of their friends rolling in every direction
    and I’d laugh too to see you so good
    As you get closer to the top of the mountain
    the sun gets warmer
    the sun gets warmer
    and the air gets thin
    There is probability of suffering
    there is certainty of death
    come inside, let me look at you,
    have you eaten yet?
    Are you longing for reason?
    Or for reasons I won’t understand?
    If it’s within reason, If you could stand,
    could you give me a hand?
    Help me harvest these tomatoes
    and their sweet, sour grandeur?
    I whistle while rolling stones
    away from the fruits of our labor
    Are you longing for a reason?
    Or for reasons I won’t understand?
    If it stands to reason or not
    could you stand to give me a hand?
    I asked about the words scratched in your skin
    You say "Oh these? I forget about them
    I was young and bored and it seemed like a thing to do
    and now the thing to do is done and I have this tattoo"
    And our bodies pick some things up
    and let other things go
    and I’m no longer young
    but I’m not yet old
    You ask about the sight loss in one eye
    I revealed to you in half moonlight
    When I couldn’t find my way in your strange room
    the thing I didn’t see coming came as these things often do
    And our bodies pick some things up
    and let other things go
    and I can see you with one good eye
    and you’re beautiful
    Wrote lists of flowers that bloom all summer long
    and things for half-shade gardens
    things to attract green throated hummingbirds
    and window-planter onions
    And it’s been a long year
    and I’d like to get to where
    it having been a long year is a good thing
    For now I’m stuck here
    and I’d like to get where
    the things I have to grow are growing
    Rifled through letters from years ago
    from people I no longer talk to
    written to someone I haven’t been for some time now
    to someone I don't remember
    And I’ve had some off years
    and I’d like to get where
    the days come and I really feel them
    But for now I’m stuck here
    a bit lost, with clear
    detailed plans for an ample garden
    I’m gonna have a garden
    I’m gonna grow a garden
    Summer grips Riverside, California
    where there’s no respite of ocean breeze
    too far from the coast in the Inland Empire,
    where snakes lie in the shade around orange trees
    And I could say that there’s donkeys in the Box Spring Mountains
    but I don’t think you’d believe me
    but it’s not a case for belief or faith
    last count puts a them at three hundred at least
    And the news this morning warns it’s been hot
    and that it will be hot today
    the radio’s discussing the Mt Rubidoux fire incident
    and the dismissal of foul play
    I think about the snakes in the shade
    and the big cats moving between streams
    that feed the sun-stained orange groves
    that repeat and stretch themselves out endlessly
    I tell you they escaped in the 1900s
    but I don’t think you believe me
    but it’s not a case of belief or faith
    these mountains are full of donkeys, wild and free
    We pull sweaters on our bodies
    birds fly in between the trees
    we trip a bit on the sidewalk bricks
    whose bright idea were these?
    And a cold, warm light falls through red and golden leaves
    in a magic sort of way I can’t articulate with ease
    What can be said about fall in Massachusetts
    except that it’s like falling in love
    any description would be useless
    who can describe falling in love?
    Winter’s biting at the edges
    and the birds are leaving soon
    but that’s far off yet, for now I get
    to flirt between red and golden trees with you
    You hold my hand and smile and
    it’s cold and warm I get confused
    you say you’re falling in love with me
    I say I fall in Massachusetts you
    Stay the same
    never change
    I love you like a sister
    Have a cool summer
    watch out for bummers
    I love you like a sister
    Stay cool, stay sweet
    stand on your two feet
    I love you like a sister
    You’re my best friend forever
    I wish we could have gotten
    to know each other better
    I love you like a sister
    I love you like a sister I don’t talk to
    I love you like a sister I forget about
    I love you like a sister
    I love you like a sister
    Thank you for calling, could you please hold?
    none of our agents are available
    due to circumstances beyond our control
    we seem to be at the end of the world
    Thank you for calling, could you please hold?
    Wind whipping through the tall sweet grass
    waving green against blue
    I felt only motion
    I saw only you
    I saw you and thought of pomegranates
    of birds in diving flight
    I felt my pulse
    I felt alright
    Which one of these days
    will they come up with a word to describe you?
    until then, pomegranates,
    and a climbing pulse will have to do
    Until then, pomegranates and diving birds will do
    Not sure how I got here
    guess I was just floating on
    with the flotsam and jetsam
    don’t remember the wreck I floated from
    I guess I’ve been numb
    not sure that that’s better than being aware
    but I know it hurts less
    and I know I’ve been scared
    Now I don’t fear anything
    I don’t feel anything
    a ghost ship sailing around unmanned
    Dead man walking around
    lost at sea, only found
    drowning on dry land
    Not sure how I got here
    guess I was just floating on and on and on
    with the flotsam and jetsam
    I brought along the wreck I floated from
    It was nice out
    we kept the windows closed
    we were under the weather
    we were indisposed
    I suppose some air wouldn’t kill us
    suppose there’s low risk of solar flare
    but if this is how we feel indoors
    how the hell are we gonna live out there?
    where people are happy?
    where people are happy?
    where people are happy?
    where people are happy and just walking around?
    You fill vases with various seasons
    bright spring daisies, summer peonies
    forget-me-nots in the fall
    In the winter we put most things away
    in the winter nothing grows but patience
    impatiently, if at all
    So we wait and we remember
    and we hold on to each other
    and eventually the light lengthens
    and the world begins to thaw
    And I found you sitting in the kitchen like an epilogue
    applying joyful scrutiny to a seed catalogue
    I brought a pie to a knife fight
    said "let’s solve this over a bite"
    at which point you swung at me
    I bit my tongue
    you flashed your teeth
    and I don’t know how this ends except badly
    And when I called to say let’s bury the hatchet
    I meant metaphorically, not in my neck
    forgive me but I keep forgetting
    that you don’t forgive or forget
    "You want to shoot me? Go ahead!"
    is the last thing I said
    before you leveled your guns at me
    "aw shoot," I thought
    seems the same thought caught
    your head as you clicked off the safety
    When I called to say let’s bury the hatchet
    I meant metaphorically, not in my neck
    forgive me but I keep forgetting
    that you don’t forgive or forget
    I could send you a text
    I could call your phone
    I could tell you I love you
    and you’re not alone
    But even if I want to
    I know I won’t
    but you know I love you
    or maybe you don’t
    And in the end
    do I have any friends?
    or do I have people who don’t mind me?
    Oh don’t mind me
    I’m just going through it
    again and again and endlessly
    And in the end
    I don’t think it ends
    I think it all just repeats
    And in the end
    do I have any friends?
    oh don’t mind me
    don’t mind me
    Could you send me a text?
    could you call my phone?
    could you tell me you love me
    and I’m not alone?
    I mean I know you love me
    or maybe you don’t
    maybe we’re all just
    on our own
    If absence makes the heart grow fonder
    you must all be fond of me
    grief divided is made lighter
    my grief divides endlessly
    I feel alright
    I feel light headed
    I could call you up
    but I know enough
    about where this is headed
    If absence makes the heart grow fonder
    you must all be fond of me
    The coffee's stale, but it’s hot
    and I’m glad for what I've got
    try not to think about
    the things that I don’t have
    I’ve got someone to love
    that’s more than I dreamed of
    I try not think about
    the people I’ve lost
    I’ve got a place to sleep
    some nights I even dream
    eyelids fluttering
    bit and piece memories
    I’ve got someone to love
    that's more than I dreamed of
    try not think about
    the people I’ve lost
    And it’s all bit and piece
    and gap and empty
    I’m glad for what I’ve got
    for what I’ve had
    I've got a breadbox full of bills
    I've got a billfold full of nothing
    I've got a payday in ten
    that I've already spent
    I've got worse things coming
    And I love you
    yes, I love you
    but I need money
    I've got a breadbox full of bills
    I've got a billfold full of nothing
    All my favors cashed in
    bad best options
    worse things coming
    And I love you
    yes, I love you
    but I need money
    I’ve got a devil on one shoulder
    and an angel on the other
    got a monkey on my back
    and they’re all screaming at each other
    Trying to get my head around
    how things got so out of hand
    I’ve got a lump inside my throat
    I’ve got voices in my head
    I’ve got voices in my head
    I’ve got voices in my head
    Now not to seem too tongue in cheek
    I’ve got a bad taste in my mouth
    and it’s been with me all week
    and I don’t think it’s coming out
    So I’ll just talk to myself
    I’ll talk underneath my breath
    I don’t need to talk at all
    I’ve got voices in my head
    I’ve got voices in my head
    I’ve got voices in my head
    I had your hand held tight, thumbed your knuckles like rosaries
    In a garden full of thorns and ferns and worms and rayed-head chicory
    as my stomach turned to knots of want and whined penitently
    I’ve got a bad feeling in my gut
    I’ve got love in my heart
    I’ve got decades ahead and behind of Hail Marys
    And you walked a stones throw and looked at me
    brown eyes, glory, joy, sorrow, mystery
    A borrowed bike
    red wine confidence
    you were a lightning strike
    of loveliness
    light bearer
    white phosphorous
    on a used Western Flyer
    all chrome and rust
    frequent flyer
    please wait for us
    joy to joy
    and dust to dust
    I’ve got a hometown I don’t live in anymore
    I’ve got friends that I don’t talk to
    thinking back I was unthoughtful with my past
    I don’t think I ever thought to
    Think about what I had been leaving behind
    all sharks know is to swim forward or die
    It’s a miracle you ain’t dead yet
    I said to myself, to my house plants
    trying to get survival conditions right
    breathing back and forth and storing up sunlight
    mixing the soil with any leaves that were cast aside
    what will they do with me once I have gone and died?
    Filled a garden gun with snake shot
    chased me out of your plot
    grazed my ear
    knew you couldn’t kill me
    May your garden grow high
    may it blot out the god damn sky
    may you have good fortune
    may it bury you
    And you hurl stones and curses at the hedges
    when you see me move among them at the edges
    of your acre
    well you gotta sleep sometime
    May your garden grow high
    may it blot out the god damn sky
    may you have good fortune
    may it bury you
    I was in the backroom making repair kits for broken hearts
    just a mixtape and a message that reads it’s not your fault
    you can take it as you need it try not to mix it with alcohol
    you can operate heavy machinery, take yourself to the mall
    Lose yourself in a crowd,
    turn this song up loud:
    It’s not your fault
    It’s not your fault
    It’s not your fault
    It’s not your fault
    It’s not your fault
    It’s not your fault
    It’s not your fault
    I was in the backroom making repair kits for broken hearts
    “The sky is low
    The clouds are mean”
    You’re reciting poetry
    and ignoring me
    Well 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
    olly olly oxen free
    the cows are coming home,
    won’t you come back to me?
    “The sky is low
    The clouds are mean”
    The cows are coming home,
    won’t you come back to me?
    Got a potential spam call from Spokane, Washington
    where I don’t know anyone
    wonder if someone sold my number or if it’s
    more like they just try a bunch
    Somewhere a machine
    tries to talk to a machine
    soft rains falling in Spokane
    it all repeats
    Got a potential spam call from Spokane, Washington
    where I don’t know anyone
    My apartment
    is by the highway
    I can pretend the cars are crashing waves
    An escarpment
    over the highway
    cars eroding the roads like ocean waves
    A glove compartment
    a sea of highway
    pieces of car and cross marker graves
    Highway department
    a whale carcass
    a twisted wreck along the interstate
    In my apartment
    I’m underwater
    I missed my exit, I tried to catch a wave
    My apartment
    is by the highway
    I can pretend the cars are crashing
    Boarding you looked before you leaped
    and it shouldn’t bother me
    hell, it was prudent
    I asked if you’d jump ship on me
    you said hell, that’s blasphemy
    of course you wouldn’t
    And I should have a little faith
    you’ve got a case, but negatives
    can’t be proven
    And it’s smooth sailing off the coast
    but ships are built with lifeboats
    because they might use them
    I asked if you’d jump ship on me
    you laughed and looked at the sea
    The dogs are all barking
    there’s a pain inside my head
    the sea is boiling
    and the sky is turning red
    add it all up
    there’s only one thing it can mean
    you’re out there somewhere
    and you’re thinking about me
    and you’re thinking about me
    Graves burst wide open
    old wounds begin to bleed
    and seven trumpets sound
    the last three just for me
    Add it all up
    there’s only one thing it can mean
    you’re out there somewhere
    and you’re thinking about me
    and you’re thinking about me
    I've been eating bird seed
    I've been throwing up bird song
    I've been praying the rosary
    I've been getting the words wrong:
    Oh Hail Mary, look at this place
    the lord has left me
    Oh glory be, give me a break
    I don't need glory
    Open your purse strings
    I can't eat glory
    Father almighty give me some money
    some ugly money
    I've been eating bird seed
    I've been throwing up bird song
    It’s enough that I dressed up
    what more do you want from me?
    it’s not like they’ll even know
    what I’m wearing
    We put them in the ground
    we put them in the ground
    because they’re gone
    And I know it was sudden
    it’s coming for all of us
    they’ll put you in nice clothes
    and stuff you in a box
    And put you in the ground
    put you in the ground
    put you in the ground
    and not expect too much
    I stumbled drunk and racked up damages
    in the department of Romance languages
    at my local university
    I cried, “Tomorrow is cancelled; we’re calling quits."
    cited lacking interest and a failure
    to plan sufficiently
    I walked back home
    I wrote bad poems
    I sang sad songs
    I called your phone
    can’t remember if you answered
    Tomorrow came stumbling all the same
    I forgot my words I went insane
    with all the things I wish I could unsay
    I cried “Yesterday is cancelled, please omit
    from the record its existence;
    it’s in schedule conflict with today."
    I stayed home
    I wrote no poems
    I sang no songs
    I lost my phone
    I heard something ringing
    Treated a live microphone
    like it was a confessional
    you all heard me
    I was not absolved
    what did I think
    that this would solve?
    I drive my nails
    into my palms
    Jesus Christ
    100 songs?
    who needs another
    Book of Psalms
    what was I thinking?
    Maybe I’ll make art
    maybe I’ll make money
    not from my art– don’t be funny!
    Maybe I’ll make a mess
    maybe I’ll make my bed
    maybe I’ll make choices about the voices in my head
    like whether or not I’m listening to them
    Well la la la la la la la la la
    I can’t hear you
    well la la la la la la la la la
    enough’s enough
    la la la la la la la la la
    I can’t hear you
    la la la la la la la la la
    shut the fuck up
    Maybe I’ll get big
    maybe I’ll get known
    maybe I’ll just go get drunk and stoned
    Maybe I will crash and burn
    or worse maybe I will just be cursed
    to be patiently ignored
    I asked you what you thought of that
    you said you’re bored
    well la la la la la la la la la
    I’m talking to you
    well la la la la la la la la la
    enough's enough
    la la la la la la la la la
    I'm talking to you
    la la la la la la la la la
    I won’t shut up
    I can pretend these arms are his
    I can pretend these legs are hers
    I can pretend I love you back
    I can pretend we can make this work
    I can just live in my head
    where I can make you anything
    I can just live in my head
    and lose my mind
    I want to break my jaw
    have it wired shut
    take a break from
    talking so much
    If that's what it takes
    to shut me up
    I want to miss a step
    fall down some stairs
    catch the edge of a ledge
    with my c6 vertebrae
    If that’s what it takes
    to shut me up
    Maybe I’ll get better
    maybe I’ll shut up
    The bridge wasn’t burned we just let it fall down
    The bridge wasn’t burned we just let it fall
    And I will destroy you in time
    and it will be so easy
    to let things fall apart
    it’ll be so easy
    I’ve been biting my tongue
    I’ve been swallowing blood
    moving through a nest of vipers
    Maybe they’re not just
    all venom and menace
    I know about change, stripes, and tigers
    Don’t make a sound, just get out
    Keep your head down, just get out
    Don't make friends, just get out
    Keep your head down and get out
    I’ve been moving slow
    keeping my eyes low
    In this pit of sleeping tigers
    Not curious about
    what would with no doubt
    Kill me as quick as striking vipers
    Don’t make a sound, just get out
    Keep your head down, just get out
    Don't make friends, just get out
    Keep your head down and get out
    And if a lion’s got a thorn in its paw,
    run away, and hope it’s slow on three legs
    I built memories of California
    Out of sunlight, wire and oranges
    In an apartment complex in Georgia
    I think the oranges came from Florida
    And I said:
    The heat here heats differently
    The heat here heats differently
    The heat here heats differently
    At least that’s how it feels to me
    You had the oven turned up real high
    Slices of wonder bread inside
    What a thing to be doing in July
    You pointed at one spot and sighed
    And you said:
    The heat here heats differently
    The heat here heats differently
    The heat here heats differently
    What are you trying to do to me?
    a plastic folding table and a paper table cloth
    maybe I’ll always love you, maybe not
    The clouds are heavy with weather, but the rain is holding off
    maybe you’ll always love me, maybe not
    Half-empty ketchup bottles, coolers full of melting ice
    maybe you’ll get mean, maybe you’ll stay nice
    Inflatable pool loungers, a flotation device
    maybe I’ll get mean, maybe I’ll stay nice
    Let’s have a cookout
    Let’s have a cookout
    Let’s invite everyone
    Let’s have a cookout
    Wouldn’t that be fun
    And I am boxing
    with my shadow again
    and I am talking to myself
    and I am trapped inside my head
    I’m overthinking
    the language again
    waiting on a bell to ring
    wonder what kind of shape I am in
    I don’t think it’s good
    Glass jaw, eight count
    bleeding nose, foaming mouth
    a couple blows below the belt
    knocked down, knocked out
    And I am talking
    to my shadow again
    and I am beating myself up
    for things I haven’t said
    I’m overreaching
    throwing punches again
    hoping to connect with something
    and get my balance back
    It’s not looking good
    Bleeding nose, foaming mouth
    glass jaw, eight count
    knocked down, knocked out
    caught cold in every bout
    glass jaw, eight count
    bleeding nose, foaming mouth
    caught cold in every bout
    knocked down knocked out
    I collected citrus peels and grapevine trimmings
    I threw them on the sweet-smelling fire
    I watched the sun kill itself on hillside
    Saw orange light bleed and flames climb higher
    Nearly too hot to bear right now,
    the air will grow cold in a matter of hours
    I tried my best not to fall in love
    I was quickly overpowered
    You smell like heat and cold and flowers
    and burned up bits of orange
    A six-pack in a parked car
    A stick shift for a worn clutch
    Build up of gasses in my blood
    Gas pedal with a light-touch
    Nothing new on the radio
    good weather on the forecast
    Just one point in the universe
    Wonder how long it’s gonna last
    No traffic at all today
    Heat expanding the air
    No traffic at all today
    I’m not going anywhere
    I saw you wreathed in white
    scent of orange on the wind
    Suddenly I felt
    my life begin
    Something borrowed
    something blue
    the scent of orange
    the sight of you
    Something old
    something new
    the start of something overdue
    The scent of orange
    The sight of you
    All of our days
    coming into view
    Oh what a horror show
    you said reading my horoscope
    Don’t go outside today
    There’s nothing for you out there anyway
    Oh how surprising
    there’s a bad moon rising
    and it’s affecting the tides
    Things can pull you from so far away
    I became entangled in
    Strange sets of angles
    That all fell in place today
    As you read me nonsense in your serious way
    Things can pull you from far away
    I read my future in your face
    Things can pull you from far away
    We licked the paper back
    of temporary tattoos
    I stuck one on ya
    I stuck it on you
    It said I love ya
    It said I love you
    It said I love ya
    It said I love you
    We licked the paper back
    of temporary tattoos
    How long will it last
    I stuck it on you
    How long will it last
    It said I love you
    It said I love ya
    It said I love you
    It said I love ya
    It said I love you
    The years passed by like days
    And the days passed by like hours
    Putting flowers in a vase is
    A great way to kill flowers
    Soon as you bloom
    You start losing all your power
    I’ve had some tough years these days
    I’ve worked some awful hours
    I am not what I thought I’d be
    I am not what I want to be
    I don’t got what you want from me
    I am not what I thought I’d be
    And at nights I stay awake
    These days I’m tired, overpowered
    You can see in my face
    Every waking hour
    How’d I get to a place
    Where I lost all my power
    I have dreams sometimes
    That I cannot remember
    Vulpinic acid kills wolves
    But not rabbits
    It’s found in the lichen
    That grows and inhabits
    The woods full of wolves
    With mouths full of rabbits
    It’s tragic
    Some people kill deer
    To have bait for predators
    The lichen grows poison
    On live and dead conifers
    The deer are filled with
    Glass shards all powdered
    Placed in the woods
    To be sharply devoured
    By wolves
    Watch what you eat
    You got blood in your teeth
    You got glass in your hand
    And your within reach
    Of something so quiet so violent
    And hungry for meat
    Some things grows slower
    Than the slow growing forest
    Their role unapparent but something elaborate
    And they’ll outlive us all, send some to death howling
    Or just blow away and become their surroundings
    In time
    You were bailing out water from the ocean
    Where you gonna put it? Where you gonna put it?
    Supercalifragilisticexpeali-oh shit
    What are you doing? What are you doing?
    What kind of magic are you in tune with?
    To part water or to walk its surface?
    Will you stop the flood or drown me with it?
    What kind of magic are you in tune with?
    Do you breathe air? Is there blood in your spit?
    Do you drink wine? Is there blood in your spit?
    Do you drink water? Is their blood in your spit?
    Do you breathe air? Is there blood in your spit?
    I was swallowed by a whale
    Said “I think I can do more good from the inside”
    But I can’t make heads or tails of this fluke
    And mouth, that swallowed me wholly
    And whales don’t think about
    The things that they’re eating
    Machines don’t think about
    Well they don’t think of anything
    And god don’t think about
    The static of prayer and pleading
    I’ve been swallowed by a whale
    I’m devoting myself to its machinery
    And hunger is old
    And the ocean is older than hunger or feeling
    And there’s a taste of salt
    In all the swallowing mouths feeding and screaming
    God sent the flood
    I didn’t notice
    God sent the flood
    The whale didn’t notice
    God sent the flood
    The machines didn’t notice
    God sent the flood
    I didn’t notice
    I’m drunk in the aquarium again
    Shark-grinning at the fish and scaring them
    I won’t tap on the glass
    You’re not supposed to do that
    When I die throw my body in the sea
    Let it skeletonize and become a reef
    Let some other things
    Live their lives inside me
    I wasn’t a great person
    Maybe I’ll be a better anemone
    Objects in motion, the tides of the ocean
    The pull of stars, mirrors behind bars
    All frame a fearful symmetry
    Last night I dreamed a tiger was eating me
    I got out by the skin of my teeth
    I got out with my skin on his teeth
    I got out by the skin of my teeth
    Don’t forget to floss
    I lost the plot
    One more drink is enough I think
    But enough's not enough when the going gets rough
    Got a rough idea of the bad shape I’m in
    Gonna drive off a pier into the ocean
    And drive and drink what’s pouring in
    Last night I dreamt I was being eaten
    Last night I dreamt I was eating a lamb
    Don’t forget to floss
    I lost the plot
    We hurt ourselves less when we’re together
    We hurt each other more
    We don’t find any moral imperatives
    imperative anymore
    We do things
    Contrary to reason
    Contrary to good sense
    To what’s kind or decent
    We do things
    That aren’t kind or decent
    Contrary to goodness
    Contrary to reason
    Treating a sickness for life with bedrest
    We wake late in the day
    We hold on to each other a while
    And then we break away
    We do things
    And we don’t mean them
    Come on now
    One more time without feeling
    We do things
    That aren’t kind or decent
    Contrary to goodness
    Contrary to reason

    Hey there, thanks for reaching out!
    Can you tell me what this is all about?
    About what you want and what you need?
    Not that I can do much of anything
    I’m just here to listen
    Sometimes to respond
    Most times I simply
    Pass the message on
    They gave me documents
    And a telephone
    A lot of buttons and
    A microphone
    I have no idea
    What any of this means
    I asked my boss, he said, ‘Don’t ask me.’
    I’m just here to listen
    Sometimes to respond
    Most times I just pass
    The message on
    I hope this helps!
    I hope this helps!
    I hope it all just resolves itself!

    The spotted lantern fly is an invasive species
    Invading all the trees of Pennsylvania and New Jersey
    The spotted lantern fly doesn’t have any enemies
    Except for praying mantises, a cure worse than the disease
    Have you seen an insect eat another insect?
    Have you seen a man kill another man?
    Oh, I saw both on tv last night
    I saw both in the street last night
    They put my street on tv last night
    I saw both on tv last night
    Nightly news top stories
    Nature documentaries
    All bad news for all concerned
    I’ve got work in the morning
    I was 16
    I bought a lighter
    I wasn’t yet smoking
    I just liked having fire and knowing
    if things went bad I could make them worse
    Limited potential
    Affordable fuel source
    Do you have a light?
    Yes I have a light
    Do you have a light?
    Yes I have a light
    I was 16
    I started smoking
    I had the lighter
    A baseball bat
    and some tennis balls
    some gasoline
    a plastic Bic lighter
    A dry fire season
    A dry fire season getting drier
    I’m making shooting stars
    out of tennis balls
    and a little fire
    I watch them flash and soar
    Not sure what to wish for
    Maybe to feel lighter
    I’m making shooting stars
    out of tennis balls
    and a little fire
    I watch them flash and soar
    Not sure what to wish for
    I just feel tired
    I got a headache that a beheaded saint would say,
    ‘Hey this seems a little much’
    ‘This seems like too much’
    Starting to think I wasn’t built for this place
    I’m only renting these days, what can I say but:
    God bless this mess
    As I chase my bliss
    As I chase my dog
    All over the place
    As I miss my bus
    As I fall on my face
    As I chip my tooth
    As I fall from grace
    As I whistle and wheeze
    Through a cracked set of teeth
    And wonder what floss ever got me?
    As my brain starts to pound
    And I hear the sound
    Of some god or dog barking
    I got a headache that a beheaded saint would say,
    ‘Hey this seems a little much'
    'This seems like too much’
    Starting to think I wasn’t built for this place
    I might make like a saint
    I might just head off
    I’ve been talking in my dreams
    I’ve been walking in my sleep
    I’ve been frightened by falling in my dreams
    I’ve had nights when I’ve had trouble falling asleep
    I’ve been walking in my dreams
    I’ve been talking in my sleep
    I’ve been talking about my dreams
    I’ve been falling in and out of sleep
    I’ve been dreaming of you and no one else
    I’ve been talking to you to myself
    I’ve been dreaming of no ones else but you
    I’ve been talking to myself to you
    I’ve been talking in my dreams
    I’ve been walking in my sleep
    Hang in there baby
    It’s only morning
    It’s only Monday
    It’s just one more thing
    Or I guess maybe
    It’s one more, more thing
    How many more things
    Till I go crazy?
    Till I go
    Which of these mornings
    Will I go?
    Come on now baby
    It’s barely evening
    It’s still early
    You can’t be sleeping
    I mean surely
    You must be keeping
    Dreams of something
    Worth staying sleeping
    Worth staying awake
    Worth staying
    Hang in there baby
    It’s only morning
    I used to sit alone
    I used to eat alone
    I used to sleep alone
    I used to be alone
    You used to sit alone
    You used to eat alone
    You used to sleep alone
    You used to be alone
    We used to
    We used to
    We used to
    We used to
    I love you
    We Used to
    I love you
    We used to
    Hey friend it’s been, what?
    A couple of years?
    What’s a couple of years between friends?
    What’s a couple hundred things left unsaid?
    What’s a couple grand ill spent?
    I am a bad investment
    I’m begging you to make again
    I am a bad investment
    I’m begging you to make again
    You won’t be sorry
    I won’t say sorry
    You won’t be sorry
    I won’t say sorry now
    Fool you once
    Shame on me
    Fool you twice
    Shame on me
    Fool you again and again
    You’re a good mark
    You’re my best friend
    I’m sorry
    Like a bird in an airport
    Like a fly in a window pane
    I am stuck in the open
    No use for wings in a cage
    I am grounded, surrounded
    So close yet so far away
    From some kind of escape
    It’d be funny
    If it wasn’t so funny
    It’d be funny
    If it wasn’t so sad
    Oh I’d be laughing
    If I wasn’t laughing
    Sometimes I laugh
    So hard I cry
    And the one horse this town’s got
    Must have up and died
    Because this bar is so empty
    That it feels smaller outside
    And when you have no money
    And you have no ride
    The expanse of everything
    Is just one less place to hide
    And you don’t have to go home
    But you can’t stay here
    Why don’t you fly in a circle
    Pretend you went somewhere
    It’d be funny
    If it wasn’t so funny
    It’d be funny
    If it wasn’t so sad
    Oh I’d be laughing
    If I wasn’t laughing
    Sometimes I laugh
    So hard I cry
    I’m a social drinker
    I am anti-social
    It’s been sobering to admit
    I am dumb, I am drunk, I am lonely
    You could be dumb, drunk and lonely with me
    When I was young I flunked social studies
    I was drunk most school nights with my friends
    I was dumb, I was drunk, I was lonely
    They were dumb, drunk and lonely with me
    I got older and I repeated history
    I didn’t learn anything
    I am a social climber
    A drinker and driver
    Can I give you a ride?
    Climb you like a ladder rung?
    Would it be bad or better if I had simply never said this out loud to anyone?
    I am dumb, I am drunk, I am lonely
    You could be dumb, drunk and lonely with me
    We stripped the walls of copper wiring
    Mined our days for silver linings
    We are hungry engines low on fuel
    We’re pretending the tank is full
    We’ve got miles and miles to go
    We unburdened heirlooms of their gemstones
    Traded sentiment for quick loans
    W are diamonds in the rough
    Out of our minds and deep in love
    We’ve got miles and miles to mine
    And we’ve got money and we’ve got what we need it for
    And when we run out we’ll just have to find some more
    And we have each other
    In sickness and in health
    For richer and for poorer
    For better or else
    You’re a point in the darkness
    You’re the curved road at night
    You’re the distracted driver
    You’re the deer in headlights
    Oh dear, oh god,
    You’ve come so far
    For someone so lost
    And here you are
    All fear and car
    Combustion and exhaust
    Won’t you slow down?
    Won’t you stop?
    You won’t slow down
    You won’t stop
    You’re the distracted driver
    You’re the deer in headlights
    You’re a point in the darkness
    You’re the darkness at night
    If hell is other people then
    It must be lonely in heaven
    I’m other people to my friends
    I hope I don’t bother them
    I’m making hell out of heaven
    I’m making hell out of heaven
    And oh hell, I meant well
    But you know what they say
    About this road and intentions
    And how it has been paved
    I’m driving 100 miles an hour
    Down lonely interstate
    I could pull over and call you
    But what the hell would I say?
    What the hell could I say?
    I’m making hell out of heaven
    I’m making hell out of heaven
    Tell the rearview and the radio to speak among themselves
    Hell is other people and I have become someone else
    Hey friend I’ve been calling
    Leaving messages till your voicemail's full
    Hey friend I’ve been knocking
    On your door until my fist is raw
    Come out, come out, wherever you are
    I’ve got the place surrounded
    I see light underneath your door
    Don’t you know we love you?
    Don’t you want to be loved?
    Come on come outside
    What are you afraid of?
    Hey friend I’ve been calling
    Hey friend I’ve been knocking
    Hey friend I’ve been calling
    Hey friend I’ve been knocking
    I can hear your phone ring
    I can see light underneath your door
    Ok I’ll stop calling
    I won’t come around anymore
    My head's a nice place to visit but I wouldn’t want to live there
    You’ve got a cheap brush, you have nice hair
    I’ve been out of my head, I’ve been nowhere
    I bought a nice brush, I have bad hair
    Should I give some thought to all this overthinking?
    Do you get caught between these fits of feeling?
    Is it a problem of push or pull or the conditioner I’m using?
    Maybe it’s in my head
    It gets a bit confusing
    I think I understand
    I might be overthinking
    Stephanie, you have nice hair
    Stephanie, you have nice hair
    Stephanie, you have nice hair
    Stephanie, your hair looks nice
    Drunk on a plane again
    Enjoying a break in the turbulence
    Duty-free whiskey in my hands
    Duty-free days ahead
    I’m going to need a vacation from my vacation
    I’m going to need a drink for this drink
    What do you think?
    Isn’t flying marvelous?
    Breathing the same air again and again?
    Isn’t flying marvelous?
    What’s a little turbulence?
    After all it’s not the flight or fall that kills you
    It’s all in how you land
    I’m going to need a vacation from my vacation
    I’m going to need a drink for this drink
    You think maybe I’ve had enough
    Here’s what I think of what you think:
    There are emergency exits
    At the front and rear of craft
    And I invite you to use either
    If you’re gonna be like that
    So you’re some hot shot pilot?
    I’m the king of the air
    I’ve got nowhere to be
    I can go anywhere
    I gave you a ride to the airport
    The sun got caught in your hair
    The light bounced off your sister’s silver bracelets
    I thought about you up in the air
    I kept checking the time
    I was nervous
    I didn’t want you to miss your flight
    Your hair really is gorgeous
    I didn’t want you to leave me
    behind on the earth’s surface
    With you gone I’m a big dumb planet
    In such an empty universe
    We drove past arrivals
    I was nervous
    Light was bouncing off your silver bracelets
    The rearview mirror’s just a piece of my own face
    Looking at my own face
    I kept checking the time
    I was nervous
    I didn’t want you to miss your flight
    Your hair really is gorgeous
    I didn’t want you to leave me
    behind on the earth’s surface
    With you gone I’m a big dumb planet
    In such an empty universe
    I kept checking the time
    I was nervous
    This day has been one long month
    It’s been like that all year
    Last night I got so drunk
    That all my sobering thoughts disappeared
    And I had a moment of clarity
    And I tried to build a home in that moment
    If I could just get infinity
    In a whiskey glass, I could hold it
    But I felt the hands of the clock move
    I felt emptiness in my glass
    I heard my blood buzz in my ears
    I resigned myself to the math
    That says zero’s an awfully big number
    That nothing’s coming for us all
    And it’s bad luck to toast with what’s empty
    But it’s all I have after last call
    Here’s to you
    Here’s to me
    Here’s to the nothing chewing its own teeth
    Here’s to you
    Here’s to me
    On and on, etc.
    Have to make do with what can be found
    All the same, the theory is sound
    You can taste the salt the air brings
    Sun warm on my face and my new wings
    More wax
    More feathers
    You can’t keep me here forever
    If I should plummet into the sea
    And cling for life on my own debris
    Wash up tangled on the shore
    I’m only going to try some more
    More wax
    More feathers
    You can’t keep me here forever
    Thirst at your heels in the morning
    Hunger at your throat by night
    Go on get lost hunting monsters
    That’s the way the trap’s designed
    You can kill the thing you think is at its heart
    Still fail to make it out alive
    Have you been here before?
    Would it even help to know?
    Falling looks like flying
    When you see it from below
    Obsessed with finding the one thing
    You could strangle while it sleeps
    And your life could finally start
    The moment it no longer breathes
    Just make sure with each turn you don’t lose yourself
    Trying to find some inner peace
    Have you been here before?
    Would it even help to know?
    Falling looks like flying
    When you see it from below
    From the moment I saw you
    I loved you
    I loved you
    If we could be wed
    Or wrapped up in thread
    I’d love to be a part of you
    I’d face or betray
    Kingdoms and fathers
    Brothers and monsters
    And I’d sail away
    From a place I called home
    If I could call you my own
    So please don’t betray me
    Sail away from me
    Leave me alone
    From the moment I saw you
    I loved you
    I loved you
    I’ve been away
    I’ve been through a lot, I forgot
    To switch out my black sails
    I didn’t mean to bring this home
    I’ve been fighting monsters
    I have been a monster
    I didn’t mean to bring this home
    Saw you up on a cliff
    My heart jumped joyfully
    You saw my ship coming in
    You jumped into the sea
    Black sails
    Air gets heavy this far underground
    It heightens taste and dampens sound
    I can smell the iron my food bleeds
    I will devour what dares hunt me
    More paths
    Than you can measure
    I sit waiting at the center
    Holding a memory of faded green
    I pray, for what they’ve done to me:
    May all sons lose their fathers
    May all fathers lose their sons
    Especially me
    And my father
    I sit ready in the darkness
